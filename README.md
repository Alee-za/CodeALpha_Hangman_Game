______________________ HANGMAN GAME ______________________

This is a simple Hangman game implemented in Python. 
The game selects a random word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess the word one letter at a time. 
The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed before the game ends.

-- How to Play -- 
  1. The game starts by asking the player for their name.
  2. The player is greeted and informed that the game is starting.
  3. A random word is chosen from a predefined list of words.
  4. The player is prompted to guess a letter.
  5. The game displays the word with guessed letters revealed and unguessed letters as underscores.
  6. The player continues to guess letters until they either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.

-- Usage --
To play the game, simply run the script in a Python environment. The game will prompt you for your name and guide you through the process of guessing the word. Follow the prompts to input your guesses and see your progress displayed on the screen.

-- Code Explanation --
The game is implemented in Python and makes use of basic control structures such as loops (while and for), conditional statements (if, else), user input handling (input()), string manipulation, and list operations. 
Key Python modules used include:
  - time: Used for introducing delays in the program execution to enhance the user experience.
  - random: Used for randomly selecting a word from a predefined list of words, making each game session unique.

-- Features -- 

  1. Dynamic Word Selection: The game randomly selects a word from a list of predefined words, ensuring variety in gameplay.
  2. Interactive Gameplay: Players are engaged through prompts for input, real-time feedback on guessed letters, and updates on remaining attempts.
  3. Win and Lose Conditions: The game dynamically checks for win conditions (correctly guessing all letters) and lose conditions (exceeding the allowed number of incorrect guesses).
  4. User Interaction: Designed to be user-friendly with clear messages for each step of the game, including winning and losing outcomes.

-- Future Improvements --
     
  1. Difficulty Levels: Implement different difficulty levels with varying word lengths or stricter guess limits.
  2. Graphics or ASCII Art: Enhance user interface with ASCII art for the hangman figure or visual clues.
  3. Multiplayer Support: Add support for multiplayer mode, allowing players to take turns guessing or competing against each other.
