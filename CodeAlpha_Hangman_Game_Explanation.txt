____________________ SUMMARY __________________

The provided Python script implements a simple Hangman game, utilizing the `time` module to introduce delays and the `random` module to randomly select a word from a predefined list of words. The game begins by prompting the player for their name, greeting them, and initiating the game with a slight pause for effect. A word is randomly chosen from a list containing terms like "secret," "python," and "hangman," among others. The player is then prompted to guess letters, and the script tracks both correct and incorrect guesses, displaying the correct guesses in place and underscores for the remaining letters. The player has a total of five incorrect guesses allowed, and the script provides feedback after each guess, showing all guessed letters and indicating whether the guess was correct or not. If the player guesses all letters in the word correctly before exhausting their attempts, a congratulatory message is displayed, otherwise, a losing message is shown when the attempts run out.


_______________ CODE EXPLANATION IN DETAILS _____________


Here's a theoretical explanation of the code:

1. Importing Modules:
   - The `time` module is imported to add delays to the program execution.
   - The `random` module is imported to select random elements from a list.

2. User Input:
   - The user is prompted to enter their name, which is stored in the variable `player_name`.
   - A greeting message is printed, welcoming the user to the Hangman game.

3. Introducing Delays:
   - The program waits for 1 second using `time.sleep(1)` before proceeding.
   - Another brief pause of 0.5 seconds is introduced with `time.sleep(0.5)` before starting the game.

4. Word Selection:
   - A list of possible words to guess (`words`) is defined.
   - A word is randomly chosen from this list using `random.choice(words)` and stored in `chosen_word`.

5. Initializing Variables:
   - `guessed_letters` is initialized as an empty string to keep track of the letters the user has guessed.
   - `all_guessed_letters` is initialized as an empty list to store all guessed letters.
   - `attempts_remaining` is set to 5, representing the number of allowed incorrect guesses.

6. Main Game Loop:
   - The game continues as long as `attempts_remaining` is greater than 0.
   - A counter `missed_guesses` is initialized to 0 to track the number of incorrect guesses for the current word.

7. Character Checking:
   - The program iterates over each character in `chosen_word`.
   - If the character is in `guessed_letters`, it is printed.
   - If the character is not in `guessed_letters`, a dash ('_') is printed, and `missed_guesses` is incremented.

8. Win Condition:
   - If `missed_guesses` is 0 after checking all characters, it means all characters have been guessed correctly.
   - A congratulatory message is printed, and the loop is exited.

9. Prompt for Guess:
   - The user is prompted to guess a letter, which is stored in `guess`.
   - The guessed letter is added to `guessed_letters`.
   - The guessed letter is also appended to `all_guessed_letters`.

10. Display Guessed Letters:
    - All guessed letters are printed by joining the elements of `all_guessed_letters` with spaces.

11. Incorrect Guess Handling:
    - If `guess` is not in `chosen_word`, `attempts_remaining` is decremented by 1.
    - A message is printed indicating the guess was incorrect.
    - The remaining number of attempts is printed.

12. Lose Condition:
    - If `attempts_remaining` reaches 0, a losing message is printed, and the game ends.
